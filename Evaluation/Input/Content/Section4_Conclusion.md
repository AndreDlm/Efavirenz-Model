The herein presented PBPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz after single and multiple administration of a variety of doses to healthy adults.  Furthermore, CYP3A4 induction on alfentanil can be described well with the optimized parameterization. 

Apart from interaction parameters, all optimized parameters are in a close range to the measured or calculated values. EC50 values for CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 were reduced approximately 100 fold in order to reach a relevant induction.

In conclusion, the presented efavirenz PBPK model is well-suited to be applied in drug-drug-interaction scenarios.

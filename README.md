# Efavirenz-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of efavirenz as CYP3A4 perpetrator drug 





## Repository files

Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of efavirenz, that has been carefully developed using a large number of clinical studies and evaluated within our DDI modeling network. 

The PK-Sim project file contains simulations of all published clinical studies employed during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports.
